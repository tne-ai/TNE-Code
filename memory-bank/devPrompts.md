## TNE Code Branding Standardization Architecture Session

**Date:** 2025-12-06 10:58:05  
**Mode:** Architect  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-20250514

### User Request Summary

Continue from branding standardization task with approval to proceed with 4-phase implementation plan.

### Key Prompts and Context

1. **Initial Context**: User provided comprehensive summary of TNE Code branding standardization task
2. **Plan Approval**: User confirmed 4-phase approach (package naming, UI verification, internal consistency, testing)
3. **Strategy Clarification**: Keep internal identifiers as `@roo-code/` while external UI shows "TNE Code"

### Deliverables Created

- [`memory-bank/tne-branding-standardization-plan.md`](memory-bank/tne-branding-standardization-plan.md): Complete implementation plan with phases, risk assessment, and success criteria
- Memory Bank updates: progress, activeContext, and decisionLog

### Technical Decisions

- **Internal Package Names**: All `@roo-code/*` scope packages
- **External Branding**: Consistent "TNE Code" in user-facing text
- **Implementation Order**: Package.json â†’ UI verification â†’ Internal consistency â†’ Testing

### Next Steps

Ready to switch to Code mode for implementation starting with Phase 1 (webview-ui package.json fixes).
