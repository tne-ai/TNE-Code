# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-12-06 06:28:45 - Memory Bank initialization progressing

## Decision

**Memory Bank Architecture for Roo Code Documentation**

- 2025-12-06 06:28:45 - Established comprehensive Memory Bank structure for project documentation
- 2025-12-06 06:28:45 - Decided to use markdown-based documentation with timestamped entries

## Rationale

The Memory Bank approach provides:

- **Persistent Context**: Maintains project knowledge across different development sessions
- **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Supports all Roo Code modes (Architect, Code, Debug, etc.)
- **Incremental Documentation**: Allows progressive understanding and documentation of complex codebases
- **Structured Knowledge**: Organizes information into specific categories (product context, active work, progress, decisions, patterns)

## Implementation Details

**File Structure:**

- [`productContext.md`](memory-bank/productContext.md) - High-level project overview and goals
- [`activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md) - Current status and immediate focus areas
- [`progress.md`](memory-bank/progress.md) - Task tracking and completion status
- [`decisionLog.md`](memory-bank/decisionLog.md) - Architectural and implementation decisions
- [`systemPatterns.md`](memory-bank/systemPatterns.md) - Code patterns and architectural standards

**Planned Specialized Files:**

- [`tne0-existing-code.md`](memory-bank/tne0-existing-code.md) - Comprehensive source code analysis
- [`devPrompts.md`](memory-bank/devPrompts.md) - Development prompt history tracking

**Integration with TNE0 Mode Requirements:**

- Source location analysis ([`src/`](src/) directory structure)
- Technology stack documentation (TypeScript, React, pnpm monorepo)
- Development workflow automation (Makefile creation)
- Testing strategy documentation (Jest to Vitest transition)
- UI/UX pattern documentation
- Database schema analysis (if applicable)

[2025-06-12 07:04:30] - **Decision: Created Development Makefile**

## Rationale

Added [`Makefile`](Makefile) to streamline TNE Code extension development workflow. The Makefile provides:

- **Standardized Commands**: `make install`, `make dev`, `make test`, `make build`, etc.
- **Developer Onboarding**: Clear instructions for environment setup and workflow
- **Monorepo Integration**: Proper pnpm workspace command orchestration
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting help system with `make help`
- **Security Considerations**: Guidelines for environment variable management with 1Password CLI

## Implementation Details

**Key Features:**

- 15 development commands covering full lifecycle (install → dev → test → build → package)
- Integration with existing pnpm/Turborepo build system
- Support for VSCode extension development workflow (F5 debugging, VSIX packaging)
- Clean separation of development, testing, and production concerns
- Environment variable management recommendations (direnv, 1Password CLI)

**Commands Added:**

- `make install` - Dependencies and environment setup
- `make dev` - Development mode with file watching
- `make test` - Test execution across workspaces
- `make build` - Production build
- `make vsix` - VSCode extension packaging
- `make clean` - Build artifact cleanup
- Additional utility commands for linting, formatting, type checking

This addresses the previous gap in development workflow automation identified in the Memory Bank.
